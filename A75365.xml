            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this great contention now producted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mutuall Hoſtility; ſuch hath been the the Serpentine policy of the Fomenters therof, that it hath bin carried about with ſuch cunning and deceit (taking vantage upon every occaſion to render the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Kingdome (the Iudgment, Votes, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Parliament) contemptible and deſtructive to the Common-wealth) that their way is as the way of a Serpent upon a rock beyond delineation; yet in part we may obſerve their ſubtility <hi>(tanquam anguis in herba)</hi> clad in royall Rethorick, <hi>vel rectus venit &amp; tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſus, vel Leonem agit &amp; ſavit, vel draconem agit &amp; fallit,</hi> Sometimes in menacing Proclamations, ſometimes in gracious and perſwaſive pardons, &amp;c. Thus royalty is abuſ'd and made a ſtalking, horſe to pernicious ends, as to the griefe of each loyall Subject, to the Primitive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125893:2"/>conſtitution or royality of this Kingdome, conſiſtant of of three co-ordinates, a King, and two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament meeting in one Centure of power, as the three Eſſentialls in the Deitie indiviſible, yet diſtinct) may be obſerved in His Majeſties Anſwer to the City Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for whereas his Highneſſe is humbly ſupplicated for the ſafety of this City and Kingdom, to return to the Parliament, the Baſis of the peoples ſafety and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of regality, wherein thoſe many proſperous by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt years His Majeſtie hath been inveſted, but inſtead of ſpeaking comfortable words unto His people of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall unity with His royalty, nothing but contempt is virtually caſt upon the very foundation of His Office, aſcribing (in His apprehenſion) all Love, Duty, and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty thereto, and to His Perſon, to none other, but to the inveterate enemies of both, according to the Kingdoms judgment and their own practiſe, which doth ſtrike at the very eſſence of the Kingly Office, contract betwixt King and people, to divert it to an Arbitrary uſurpation, which is no leſſe tyrannicall, than wilfull, wherewith if the City would ſide, they ſhould not want <hi>renewed marks of his favour.</hi> For at firſt obſerve, He greets them with His good opinion of it, <hi>That He doth not entertaine any miſ-apprehenſion of the love and loyally thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the greateſt part he conceives is full;</hi> But what <hi>part</hi> is this? is it not the ſame the <hi>Wiſedom</hi> of the State (which is beſt ſenſible of its own enormities) adjudgeth its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies If ſo, his Majeſty in his boſom hugs a Serpent for his ſafety, which I believe; He deſires (as He conceives) to be the greateſt part, therein purſuing His own ruine; but I hope the Lord will ſtrengthen the hands of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and proſper their worke, that they may vindicate His Highneſſe, and the Kingdoms ſafety from that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine brood, who <hi>hatch Cockatrice egges, and weave the ſpiders webbe; he that eateth of their egges</hi> (oh the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125893:2"/>infelicity of His Majeſties appetite!) <hi>dyeth, and that which is cruſhed, breaketh forth into a Viper, their works are the workes of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands, &amp;c. they have made them crooked paths, whoſoever goeth therein, ſhall not know Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas his Majeſty pretends He was driven from His Parliament by Tumults, Contrived by ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Members of the City, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This often recited PLEA is much to be admired to come from His Majeſty, for 'tis not unknown that the morrow after the greateſt of thoſe Tumults, he went to <hi>London</hi> with an ordinary retinue, which if common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may judge, argues His Majeſty was not ſo ſore terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and affrighted with feare of his ſafety as this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer imports; unleſſe madneſſe be aſcribed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to expoſe his perſon indefenſible upon the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant fury of a multitude, againſt whoſe perſon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends they were maliciouſly invected, and moſt trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly bent; but it is manifeſt to the contrary, for they went in a petitionary way (no Law being to hinder or prevent Petitioners) and if any extraordinary reſort were for any other end, it was not in the leaſt for the offence of the Kings perſon, (as is pretended) but meerly for a loyall preſentation of their lives and perſons in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the two Houſes of Parliament then greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, oppreſſed and poſſeſſed with great feares and jealouſies; this was the worſt end, (however unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſconſtrued) that they had: Therefore His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Accuſation of <hi>ſome principle Members,</hi> who are (he ſayes) <hi>well knowne ſince,</hi> &amp;c. Vaniſhes into nothing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a meer cavill, to wheell about the now affected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy deſign. To proceed His Majeſty in His Anſwer goes on thus.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:125893:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But His Majeſty deſires His good Subjects of</hi> London <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider what confidence His Majeſty can have of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity there, whilſt the Laws of the Land are ſo notoriouſly deſpiſed and trampled under foot, and the wholſome govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that City (heretofore ſo famous over all the world) is now ſubmitted to the Arbitrary power of a few deſperate perſons of no reputation, but for malice and diſloyalty to Him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Obſerve in the former clauſe lie commended the City for <hi>Love, Duty, and Loyalty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to him,</hi> and in the very ſequell condemnes them of <hi>malice and diſloyalty to him,</hi> (which groſſe contradiction, I wonder his Councell did not ſee before it was ſealed up) for probation whereof; obſerve, His Majeſty askes <hi>what ſecurity he can have here, whil'ſt the Laws of the Land are ſo notoriouſly deſpiſed and trampled under foot, and the government ſubmitted to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power of a few deſperate perſons, for malice and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to him,</hi> and yet before of that City (by whom thoſe perſons were elected to their Offices, even the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor principally aim'd at) he ſaith, <hi>He doth not entertaine any miſ-apprehenſion of their love and loyalty to him.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if theſe firſt words of his Majeſty may ſtand abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, how is the government thereof committed or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them for malice and diſloyalty to him, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (or ſubmitted as he ſtiles it) to thoſe perſons by them, who are full of <hi>love, duty, and loyalty to him:</hi> And whereas He Titles it <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> how can that be Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary either in inſtitution or execution, which hath the free choice and conſent of the Major part in both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rationality of the Kingdom, and property of the City? and doth act and move <hi>ad motum primi mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> ſubjecting to the rationality of the Kingdome, the Laws and Ordinances of Parliament? Now arbitrary government to this is abſolutely repugnant, for the one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125893:3"/>admits of the Peoples choice and conſent, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes both, and compells without either.</p>
            <p>And further, His Majeſty proceeds to poſſeſſe the world with an apprehenſion of their malice and diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by taking up arms againſt his conſent and expreſſe commands, the making of collection, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it is againſt his perſonall Commands, as withdrawn voluntarily from the ſtation of higheſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for according to the fundamentall conſtitution of this Monarchy (being a triunall mixture of three Eſtates in one ſublime power) in it can be no ſubordination or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, but a triple unity limited within the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Royall power, or elſe in the intervalls of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, or when a King demiſeth, with them the triplicity ceaſeth, and with him the office dyeth, I mean if it admit of eſſentiall diviſion or perſonall concommitance, ſo that there may be a perſonal abſence or demiſe from it, and yet the Regality remain abſolute; therefore the King (one of this triple unity of State) perſonally abſenting and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the other two, cannot <hi>ſenſu deviſo</hi> command Regal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Arbitrarily, and thoſe his commands in this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute disjunction, are directly oppoſite and deſtructive to the other two eſtates; therefore in this ſence, as He is a KING, his conſent and commands before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are none at all, but meerly perſonall and irregall, for regall commandes are tempered and compounded of the reaſon and judgement of the whole Kingdom, not of the will of one man; ſo then the Army raiſed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament is not againſt the Kings conſent or command Regall; for Regall conſent, command, and authority, is the inſeperable adjunct of this triunity; the King and two Houſes of Parliament. And whereas therein the King ſayes; That all poſſible means Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125893:4"/>and malice could ſuggeſt to them, have been uſed to take away. His life from Him, and to have deſtroyed His Royall Iſſue. Hence obſerve, how odious and contemptible He would make the other two eſtates (contrary to His many Proteſtations and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that the hearts of people might in the higheſt meaſure be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt the faithfull members and Authority thereof, to their and its utter diſſolution and deſtruction. Whence His Majeſty ſhould have this horrible miſ-conception, I know not; ſurely His Counſell found not this Diabolicall clauſe within the confines of their Declarations, Ordinances, Votes, Remonſtrances, and Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor yet read it in the ſecret characters of their hearts; but if the litrature of the heart by the outward actions and Indices of the minde, their many Declarations and Petitions, &amp;c. may be read, I am ſure envy it ſelf, nor the quintecenſe of malice can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and juſtly tax that Honorable Aſſembly of ſuch nefarious guilt, to <hi>kill the King, and destroy His Royall Iſſue;</hi> oh monſtrous Treaſon, and impious imputation not to be thought of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! and never I believe layd to their charge before, for tho it reflect more neerly upon the Army, yet though it tranſpenetrates on them, have they not, and do they not ſtill labour with all the wiſdom and policy they can to reſcue His Perſon, from His perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, peſtilent, and deſperate ſeducers, that His Throne might bee eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe an judgement (the very life of Kingly glory) on Him and His Poſterity generation after generation?</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſayes, <hi>What hope His Majesty can have of ſafety there, Whilſt Alderman</hi> Pennington, &amp;c. <hi>commit ſuch outrages in oppreſſing, robbing, according to their own diſcretion, &amp;c.</hi>

               </gap>ſty may underſtand, that what they do is not Arbitrary and at their own diſcretion, but by Authority and Ordinance of Parliament, executing Juſtice and Judgement (forceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion upon obſtinate reſiſtance) on ſuch as are able and ſhall not contrary to their Proteſtation, defend and ſupply with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the unreſiſtable neceſſities of the State; ſo that what they do in purſuance of the Ordinance of Parliament, is not to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to their diſcretion, as actions abſolute and irrelative to the Regallity of the Kingdom, and ſo meerly Arbitrary, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience to the Legiſlative power of the Land, which hath not only inſtituted and authorized the thing and them to it, but the means, order and manner of its accompliſhment: therefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125893:4"/>their actions are of obedience and not of arbitrary diſcretion, and ſo their exaction of legall mulcts is no robberry, no more then the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hangmans office is murther, and the Tax it ſelfe, which his Majeſty asketh, <hi>if it be so defend the Subjects liberty and right?</hi> To wit, to take the twentieth part? is conducent thereto, in regard it is done for the generall defence of the liberty and propertie; of the ſubiect, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cannot be without extraordinary expence; therefore in caſe of iminent neceſſity, and actuall hoſtility, (the Judgement of the ſtate finding it conducent to its ſafty, which is the end to all politique conſtitution) the means of effecting and defending the ſame, which muſt trangreſſe the bonds of ordinary ſupply, is no more repugnant and deſtructive to the liberty and property of our goods, &amp;c. then the liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty it ſelfe is to them.</p>
